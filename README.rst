pyramid_bowerstatic: BowerStatic integration for Pyramid
========================================================

pyramid_bowerstatic integrates BowerStatic_ into Pyramid_.

When you create a pyramid app, make sure to include pyramid_bowerstatic::

    config.include('pyramid_bowerstatic')

Resources can be added to the bowerstatic repository by::

    components = pyramid_bowerstatic.create_components('myapp', os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'bower_components'))


And resources can be used in views by::

    request.include(components, 'jquery')


Resource can also be inserted in the view/template directly by using::

   request.get_bowerstatic_path('myapp', 'jquery', 'jquery.js')
